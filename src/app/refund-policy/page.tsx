const FALLBACK = `Our refund and returns policy lasts 30 days from purchase. If 30 days have passed, we can't offer a full refund or exchange.

Eligibility
To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, unworn, and in original sellable condition with tags attached.

We accept return requests for:
- Sizing issues
- Misprints or defects
- Accidental duplicate orders

We do not accept returns for buyer's remorse or general dissatisfaction with a design.

Refunds
Once your return is received and inspected, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, a credit will be applied to your original payment method within a certain number of days.

Late or Missing Refunds
If you haven't received a refund yet, check your bank account, then contact your credit card company, then your bank. If you've done all of this and still have not received your refund, please contact us.

Exchanges
We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. Contact us to arrange an exchange.

Shipping Returns
You will be responsible for paying your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable.`;
