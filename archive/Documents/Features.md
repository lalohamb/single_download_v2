## SEO & Technical

- `src/app/layout.tsx` — root metadata: default title template, description, OG site name, Twitter card, Google verification tag (all from `seo_settings`)
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — dynamic XML sitemap, ISR 1hr, respects `sitemap_enabled` toggle; static routes (/, /shop, /about, /refund-policy, /terms-of-service) + all active product URLs with `updated_at`
- `src/app/robots.ts` — dynamic robots.txt, ISR 1hr; disallows /admin/, /checkout/, /api/; includes sitemap URL
- Per-product `generateMetadata`: title, description, OG image, canonical URL
- Per-product JSON-LD Product schema injected via `<Script strategy="beforeInteractive">`

---

## Product Flag System (`src/lib/productFlags.ts`)

Single source of truth for all curation badges. Each `FlagDef` has:
- `key` — boolean column on `products` table
- `label` — admin checkbox/button text
- `badge` — storefront chip text
- `badgeClass` — Tailwind classes
- `enabled` — whether it surfaces in UI

| Flag | Badge | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `featured` | Featured (gold) | Active |
| `is_new_arrival` | New (blue) | Active |
| `is_trending` | Trending (dark) | Active |
| `is_bestseller` | Best Seller (green) | Defined, disabled |
| `is_on_sale` | Sale (red) | Defined, disabled |

Adding a new badge = one line in this file + one DB column. Admin editor, bulk toolbar, product list, and ProductCard all iterate `ACTIVE_FLAGS` automatically.

## Infrastructure & DevOps

- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage (deps → builder → runner), `output: standalone`
- `docker-compose.yml` — single `web` service, `env_file: .env.local`, `restart: unless-stopped`
- `.dockerignore` — excludes node_modules, .next, .env*.local, .git
- `next.config.mjs` — `output: 'standalone'`
- `scripts/deploy.sh` + `deploy.cmd` — deployment scripts
- `scripts/setup-droplet.sh` — DigitalOcean droplet provisioning
- GitHub Actions CI/CD → DigitalOcean Droplet
- Supabase migrations (7 files): initial schema, brand settings, printify_shop_id, RLS fix, curation flags + content_lock, SEO settings, social links

## Security Hardening

### Input Validation & Injection Prevention
- **CWE-78 Command Injection**: `PM2_APP_NAME` sanitized with `safePm2AppName()` before shell interpolation in `stripe-setup` and `stripe-switch`
- **CWE-918 SSRF**: `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` validated with `/^[a-z0-9-]{1,40}$/` before URL interpolation; `layout.tsx` Supabase client fetch override blocks non-Supabase origins; `stripe-admin` validates `webhook_url` as `https:` URL
- **CWE-22 Path Traversal**: `assertWithinRoot()` in `env-utils.ts` blocks reads/writes outside app root; upload `folder` param sanitized to alphanumeric/dash/underscore
- **CWE-915 Mass Assignment**: `seo/route.ts` POST allowlists only known SEO fields; `resend/route.ts` POST allowlists only known email fields
- **CWE-20 Input Validation**: MailerLite `id`/`group_id`/`subscriber_id` validated with `/^[\w-]{1,64}$/`; `limit` clamped 1–100; `filter` validated against allowlist; Stripe `charge_id` validated against `/^ch_[\w-]{1,255}$/`; `amount` validated as positive integer; upload extension validated against allowlist; `revalidatePath` inputs validated (must start with `/`, max 256 chars, max 20 paths)
- **CWE-502 Prototype Pollution**: `sanitize()` in `stripe-checkout` Edge Function strips `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` keys recursively
- **CWE-117 Log Injection**: `e.message` and JSON payloads sanitized with `.replace(/[\r\n]/g, " ")` before logging in `affiliates`, `mailerlite` routes

### Authentication & Session
- **CWE-614 Missing Secure Flag**: Auth session cookie sets `Secure` flag when served over HTTPS
- **`requireAdmin()`**: Reads Supabase session cookie (reassembles chunked cookies), validates JWT via service role client, checks `admins` table — used on all admin API routes
- **Resend webhook**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification using svix headers (gated on `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)

### XSS Prevention
- **CWE-79**: `sanitizeImageUrl()` in `NewsletterPopup` blocks `javascript:` and `data:` URIs from DB-sourced image URLs

## Affiliate Program

### Public Routes
- `/affiliates` — program landing page
- `/affiliates/signup` — application form (name, email, platform URL, follower count, payout method/handle)
- `/affiliates/dashboard` — affiliate dashboard (earnings, conversions, referral link, payout history)

### Tracking
- Referral code stored in `localStorage` with 30-day expiry via `getAffiliateCode()` in `supabase.ts`
- `affiliate_code` passed through Stripe checkout session metadata
- `stripe-webhook` Edge Function records conversion in `affiliate_conversions` on `checkout.session.completed`
- Commission: 10% of order subtotal

### Admin Management (`/api/affiliates`)
- `approve` action: updates status to active + sends approval email via Resend
- `payout` action: creates Stripe transfer to connected account + marks payout paid + emails affiliate
