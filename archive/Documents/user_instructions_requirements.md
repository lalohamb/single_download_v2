## 1. Logging In

Navigate to `/admin`. You will be prompted for your admin email and password. Credentials are managed in Supabase under the `admins` table. Only rows in that table with a matching email are granted access.

If you are locked out, add your email directly in the Supabase dashboard under `Table Editor → admins`.

---

## 2. Dashboard

**Path:** `/admin/dashboard`

The dashboard gives you a live snapshot of the store.

### Stat Cards
| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Total Revenue | Sum of all paid, fulfilled, shipped, and delivered orders |
| Total Orders | Count of all orders (last 5 shown) |
| Pending Orders | Orders with status `pending` |
| Total Products | All products in the database |

### Order Pause Toggle
A banner at the top of the dashboard shows whether orders are currently **open** or **paused**.

- **Pause Orders** — customers will be blocked from completing checkout until you resume. Use this during inventory issues, site maintenance, or holiday closures.
- **Resume Orders** — re-opens checkout immediately.

The toggle writes directly to the `settings` table (`orders_paused` field) and takes effect on the next page load for customers.

### Recent Orders
Shows the 5 most recent orders with customer name, email, total, and status. Click **View All** to go to the full Orders page.

### Quick Actions
Shortcuts to Products, Orders, and Settings.

---

## 3. Products

**Path:** `/admin/products`

### Tabs
- **Active** — products with `status = active` that are visible to customers.
- **Inactive & Unsynced** — products with `status = draft` or `archived`, or products synced from Printify that have not been activated yet.

### Syncing from Printify
Click **Sync Printify** to pull all products from your connected Printify shop. The sync:
- Creates new product records for any Printify products not yet in the database.
- Updates title, description, images, variants, blueprint ID, print provider ID, and shipping profiles for products that are **not content-locked**.
- Requires `PRINTIFY_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local` and a valid Shop ID set in Settings → Integrations.

After a sync, new products appear in the **Inactive** tab. Review them and click **Activate** to make them visible on the storefront.

### Adding a Product Manually
Click **Add Product** to open the product modal. Fill in:
- **Title** — product name shown on the storefront.
- **Description** — supports plain text with line breaks (`whitespace-pre-wrap` rendering). Use the **Clean HTML tags** button to strip any pasted HTML.
- **Price / Cost** — retail price and your cost. Cost is for internal reference only.
- **Image URL** — paste a URL or select from the image thumbnails shown (pulled from existing product images).
- **Category** — assign to a category for shop filtering.
- **Badges** — checkboxes for Featured, New Arrival, Trending, Bestseller, On Sale.

### Editing a Product
Click the pencil icon on any active product row. The same modal opens pre-filled.

> **Content Lock:** If you edit the title, description, or image of a Printify-synced product, it becomes **content-locked** automatically. A locked product's text and image will not be overwritten on future Printify syncs. You can unlock it from the edit modal.

### Product Badges
Badges control which homepage sections a product appears in:

| Badge | Homepage Section |
|---|---|
| Featured | Featured Picks grid |
| New Arrival | New Arrivals carousel |
| Trending | Trending Now carousel |
| Bestseller | Shown with a "Bestseller" label on product cards |
| On Sale | Shown with a "Sale" label on product cards |

### Bulk Actions (Active tab)
Select multiple products using the checkboxes, then:
- **Assign Category** — set a category for all selected products at once.
- **+ [Badge]** — apply a badge flag to all selected products.
- **Set Draft** — move selected products back to inactive/draft status.

### Setting a Product to Draft
Click the **Draft** button on any active product row to hide it from the storefront without deleting it. It moves to the Inactive tab.

### Deleting a Product
Click the trash icon. You will be asked to confirm. Deletion is permanent.

### Size Sorting
On the product detail page, sizes automatically sort in the order: XS → S → M → L → XL → 2XL → 3XL → 4XL → 5XL, with any other sizes sorted alphabetically after.

---

## 4. Orders

**Path:** `/admin/orders`

### Viewing Orders
All orders are listed with order ID, customer name, email, date, total, and status. Click any row (or the eye icon) to open the order detail modal. Use the search bar to filter by name, email, or order ID. Use the status dropdown to filter by a specific status. Click **Refresh** to manually reload, or orders update automatically via Supabase Realtime.

### Order Statuses

| `shipped` | Carrier has picked up the package |
| `delivered` | Package delivered to customer |

### Order Detail
Click any row or the eye icon to open the order detail modal. From here you can:

- View customer name, email, and full shipping address.
- See all items ordered with variant, quantity, and line total.
- View subtotal, shipping cost, and order total.
- **Check Printify** — fetches the live Printify status for the order. Shows live status with a plain-English label alongside your stored status.
- **Sync to Order** — writes Printify's live status, fulfillment status, tracking number, and tracking URL into your DB.

### Cancelling an Order
Setting status to `Cancelled` is the only change that pushes back to Printify.
- If Printify confirms the cancellation → DB updated.
- If Printify rejects it (order already in production) → alert shown, DB **not** changed, dropdown reverts.

### Printify Status Labels

## 10. Shipping

**Path:** `/admin/shipping`

Shipping rates are managed by Printify and stored locally during product syncs. This page shows the current shipping status and diagnostic information.

### Shipping Modes

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Live Printify Rates | All products have stored shipping profiles. Customers see real rates |
| Partial — Mixed Rates | Some products have profiles, others use the $6.99 fallback |
| Fallback Rate ($6.99) | No profiles stored. All items use the flat fallback rate |

### Diagnostic Checks
The page runs 4 checks automatically:
1. **Printify connected** — shop is marked connected in settings.
2. **Shop ID configured** — a Printify Shop ID is set in Settings → Integrations.
3. **Blueprint data** — all products have blueprint and provider IDs (required for rate lookup).
4. **Shipping profiles stored** — all products have Printify shipping rate profiles stored locally.

Any products missing shipping profiles are listed. Fix them by going to **Products → Sync Printify**.

### How Shipping is Calculated at Checkout
1. During a product sync, the shipping rate profile for each product's blueprint and print provider is fetched from Printify's catalog API and stored in the database.
2. At checkout, the customer selects their country.
3. The stored profile for each cart item is looked up and the rate for that country is applied.
4. Cost = first item rate + (quantity − 1) × additional item rate, summed across all products.
5. If a product has no stored profile, a flat **$6.99** fallback is used for that item.

> After changing shipping rates in Printify, run a product sync to pull the updated profiles.
